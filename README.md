The official repository for the code of the paper "**Trustworthy Agents for Electronic Health Records through Confidence Estimation**". TrustEHRAgent is a confidence-aware LLM agent that incorporates step-wise confidence estimation for reliable clinical question answering on Electronic Health Records (EHRs).

This work builds upon [EHRAgent](https://github.com/wshi83/EHRAgent), introducing novel confidence estimation mechanisms and the HCAcc@k% metric to address hallucination risks in clinical AI systems.

### Features

- **Confidence-Aware Clinical AI**: TrustEHRAgent incorporates step-wise confidence estimation to address hallucination risks in clinical decision support;
- **HCAcc@k% Metric**: Novel evaluation metric quantifying the accuracy-reliability trade-off at varying confidence thresholds;
- **Trustworthy Clinical Decision Support**: Delivers accurate information when confident, or transparently expresses uncertainty when confidence is low;
- **Strong Reliability Performance**: Achieves substantial improvements of 44.23%p and 25.34%p at HCAcc@70% on MIMIC-III and eICU datasets;
- **Built on EHRAgent**: Extends the code-empowered LLM agent framework with confidence estimation capabilities.

### Data Preparation

TBD

### Credentials Preparation
Our experiments are based on OpenAI API services. Please record your API keys and other credentials in the ``./trustehragent/config.py`` or ``./ehragent/config.py``. 

### Setup

See ``requirements.txt``. Packages with versions specified in ``requirements.txt`` are used to test the code. Other versions that are not fully tested may also work. We also kindly suggest the users to run this code with Python version: ``python>=3.9``. Install required libraries with the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Instructions

The outputting results will be saved under the directory ``./logs/``. We provide convenient execution scripts in the ``scripts/`` directory:

#### Quick Start Scripts

**MIMIC-III Dataset:**
```bash
./scripts/run_code.sh
```

**eICU Dataset:**
```bash
./scripts/run_code_eicu.sh
```

**Confidence Analysis & Evaluation:**
```bash
./scripts/run_evaluate.sh
```

**Test Configuration:**
```bash
./scripts/run_test.sh
```

**Post-Evaluation Analysis:**
```bash
./scripts/run_post_analysis.sh
```

#### Key Features

- **Confidence Estimation**: Each script includes confidence analysis capabilities
- **HCAcc@k% Evaluation**: Reliability-accuracy trade-off evaluation at different confidence thresholds  
- **Dual Dataset Support**: Both MIMIC-III and eICU datasets are supported
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: From execution to post-evaluation visualization

However, despite their capabilities, the reliable deployment of LLMs in clinical settings remains challenging due to risks of hallucinations. Thus, we propose Hallucination-Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%), a novel metric quantifying the accuracy-reliability trade-off at varying confidence thresholds. Based on this framework, we also introduce TrustEHRAgent, a confidence-aware agent that incorporates step-wise confidence estimation for clinical question answering. Experiments on MIMIC-III and eICU datasets demonstrate that TrustEHRAgent outperforms baselines under strict reliability constraints, achieving substantial improvements of 44.23%p and 25.34%p at HCAcc@70% while baseline methods fail completely at these stringent thresholds."
